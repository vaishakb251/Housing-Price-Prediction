# House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is sourced from a provided `.xls` file, and the implementation is carried out in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate house prices based on various features from the dataset. The key steps include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

### Key Features
- Data preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding data distribution and correlations.
- Feature engineering for improving model performance.
- Machine learning model implementation using popular libraries such as Scikit-learn.
- Evaluation metrics for assessing model accuracy.

## File Structure
- **`House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and detailed explanations.
- **`Housing.xls`**: Dataset containing house price information and features.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
